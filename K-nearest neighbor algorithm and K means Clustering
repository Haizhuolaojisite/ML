1. K-means clustering represents an unsupervised algorithm, mainly used for clustering, while KNN is a supervised learning algorithm 
used for classification.

K-nearest neighbors
==========================================
Being a supervised classification algorithm, K-nearest neighbors needs labelled data to train on.

With the given data, KNN can classify new, unlabelled data by analysis of the k number of the nearest data points. 
Thus, the variable k is considered to be a parameter that will be established by the machine learning engineer.

Thus, k-kmeans needs training data to make predictions.

K-means Clustering
==============================================
K-means clustering represents an unsupervised clustering algorithm that needs unlabelled data to train.

K-means clustering is able to gradually learn how to cluster the unlabelled points into groups by analysis of the mean distance 
of said points. In this case, the variable k depicts the number of clusters or different groups in which the data will be gathered. 
The algorithm functions by moving the data in such manner that error function is minimized.

Differences
==============================================
KNN represents a supervised classification algorithm that will give new data points accordingly to the k number or the closest data points,

while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that gathers and groups data into k number of clusters.
