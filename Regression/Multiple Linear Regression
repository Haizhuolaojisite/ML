1. Independent variables effectiveness on prediction
    Does revision time, test anxiety, lecture attendance and gender have any effect on the 
    exam performance of students?
    
2. Predicting impacts of changes

y_hat = theta(transpose)X

where theta is an nX1 vector of unknown parameters/coefficients in a multi-dimensional space;
x is the vector of the featured sets

Theta is also called parameters or weight vector of the regression equation

should independent variables be continuous? Basically, categorical independent variables can
be incorporated into a regression model by converting them into numerical variables. 
For example, given a binary variables such as car type, the code dummy zero for manual 
and one for automatic cars. 

As a last point, remember that multiple linear regression is a specific type of linear 
regression. So, there needs to be a linear relationship between the dependent variable 
and each of your independent variables. There are a number of ways to check for linear 
relationship. For example, you can use scatter plots and then visually checked for linearity. 

If the relationship displayed in your scatter plot is not linear, then you need to use non-linear regression.
